# Vector Field Generator
Whilst gravity was calculated at runtime for [Little Cosmos](https://joebinns.com/little-cosmos), I also experimented with baking the calculation into vector fields; this is the prototype for the applet. The approach may be beneficial beyond just performance gains! The exported vector field file type is the same used by Unreal for particle systems and the chaos physics system; there's certainly more to be explored!
